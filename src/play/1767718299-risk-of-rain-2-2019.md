    The classic multiplayer roguelike, Risk of Rain, returns with an extra
    dimension and more challenging action. No run will ever be the same with
    randomized stages, enemies, bosses, and items. Play solo, or team up with up
    to four friends to fight your way through hordes of monsters, unlock new
    loot, and find a way to escape the planet.

One of my favorite games ever. I love the way the lore is told by finding logs through the different stages. 11/10
