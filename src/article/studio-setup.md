I am a software and game developer so I have tried to keep an updated enough rig that will allow me to work with 2D and 3D elements without issues, and to run the most current game engines. 

Apart from that, I am also really passionate about music. A few years ago I used to take it more seriously and tried getting gear to produce my own audio and music, but since my move to Colombia I've had to stick to the basics. A good enough mic, and my old timer audio interface.
