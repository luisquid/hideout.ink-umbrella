# digitalgh0st
Have you ever stumbled unto a IM conversation from someone who isn't longer alive? Have you ever felt an eerie sense that if you messaged them you can almost expect a response back? Reading their messages brings a nostalgic feeling of that person not being really gone? As if you were witnessing a digital ghost. 

Shinrei is a japanese term used to ghosts in a spiritual sense. It carries a mystical feeling rather than a thrilling, horror like one. I used to name this project shinrei because to me it represents the feeling I get when I run into this digital ghosts. Rather than feeling sadness and negative feelings, it is more of a nostalgic feeling of the part that was left behind in those message from the person who no longer is. 

I wanted to create a musical project similar to virtual self, but instead of focusing all relating to the self, I want to focus in the existence of the being that is no longer a self. As if whenever a person passes away they live a ghost behind in the digital space. Condemned to be a heart warming and sometimes sad reminder of the person they used to inhabit.
